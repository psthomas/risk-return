## Are there returns to risk taking in science, philanthropy, or public policy?

This is repo contains the code and data for my posts [[1](https://pstblog.com/2017/12/02/risk-return), [2](https://pstblog.com/2018/06/27/meta-returns)] about the returns to risk taking in science, philanthropy, and public policy.  This is a follows on my [earlier writing](https://github.com/psthomas/efficient-frontier) about the efficient frontier of philanthropy.  

The conclusion is that there do seem to be returns to uncertainty, but not to downside risk.  See the jupyter notebooks [[1](https://github.com/psthomas/risk-return/blob/master/returns.ipynb), [2](https://github.com/psthomas/risk-return/blob/master/meta.ipynb)] or blog posts [[1](https://pstblog.com/2017/12/02/risk-return), [2](https://pstblog.com/2018/06/27/meta-returns)] for more details.
