problem during the past 12 months from a general practitioner, psychiatrist,
psychologist, physician, surgeon, social worker, mental health
team worker or an admission to hospital [4]. It is assumed that those
consulting are receiving EBM if they have had three or more consultations
with a GP, psychiatrist or psychologist plus CBT and/or drug
treatment.
Of those with GAD, 55% consulted; these were further split into
treatment with EBM (27%) or non-EBM (28%). Those who consulted

psychologist, physician, surgeon, social worker, mental health
team worker or an admission to hospital [4]. It is assumed that those
consulting are receiving EBM if they have had three or more consultations
