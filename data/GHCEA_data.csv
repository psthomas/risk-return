problem. All prevalent cases of GAD and PD in the year 2000 are
included. Consulting is defined as seeking care for a mental health
problem during the past 12 months from a general practitioner, psychiatrist,
psychologist, physician, surgeon, social worker, mental health
team worker or an admission to hospital [4]. It is assumed that those
consulting are receiving EBM if they have had three or more consultations
with a GP, psychiatrist or psychologist plus CBT and/or drug
treatment.
Of those with GAD, 55% consulted; these were further split into
treatment with EBM (27%) or non-EBM (28%). Those who consulted
and received non-EBM under current practice each averaged 2.5 GP

Especially the three sensitivity analyses based on the study of Haagsma et al. [24] do show an enormous impact on estimated CURs. Using their mean disability weight (Haagsma 1), their mean disability weight but applying a relevance criterion (Haagsma 2) and their median disability weight (Haagsma 3) resulted in a CUR of D 18,000/DALY, D 38,000/DALY and D 62,000/DALY respectively (see Fig. 4).
